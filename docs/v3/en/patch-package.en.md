# Patches

For third-party libraries lacking maintenance, issues may remain unresolved. In such cases, you need to solve these issues on your own or rely on patches provided by others for fixes.

This informal approach is not recommended as a standard means of resolution.

See [how to use patches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package).
